#  Offensive Security Projects

Welcome to my collection of hands-on **Red Teaming exercises and offensive security labs**. These projects simulate real-world attacker behavior to strengthen both offensive capabilities and defensive detection strategies.

By emulating adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), I gain deeper insight into how threats operate — and how defenders can recognize, investigate, and respond effectively.

Each lab reflects a unique exploitation path, ranging from initial access to privilege escalation and post-exploitation. Whether it's bypassing defenses or tracing callbacks in network captures, this portfolio blends both Red and Blue perspectives for a full-spectrum security mindset.
